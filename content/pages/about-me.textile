Hi, I'm Ash :)  I'm a Ruby developer who loves to create software both 
professionally and for recreation.

When I'm not coding I'm either playing video games, hanging out with my dog "(cb-image)Maurice(Maurice the Boxer)":/ashmckenzie/images/maurice.jpg or convincing myself to get out and about and photograph the outdoors.

Feel free to say g'day :)
