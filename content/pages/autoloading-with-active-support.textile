h1. Autoload with ActiveSupport

Today I came across a really neat way of saving code (and time) when requiring libraries.

Instead of:

<pre data-language="ruby">
  require './lib/cat'
  require './lib/dog'
  require './lib/bird'

  Cat.new.attack(Dog.new) 
  Bird.new.swoop(Cat.new)
</pre>

Try this!  The only catch is you must have ActiveSupport installed.

<pre data-language="ruby">
  require 'active_support/dependencies'
  ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths << File.expand_path('../lib', __FILE__)

  Cat.new.attack(Dog.new)
  Bird.new.swoop(Cat.new)
</pre>
