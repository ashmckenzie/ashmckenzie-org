Recently, I attended "MongoDB Melbourne":http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-melbourne at The Marriott in the CBD.  The day featured the "10gen":http://10gen.com talking about MongoDB plus a few interesting lightning talks.

I really enjoyed the day and took a few notes that I found interesting:

h3. "Schema Design":https://github.com/estolfo/presentations/blob/master/Schema-design/Schema%20Design%20By%20Example.pdf?raw=true with Emily Stolfo

* Emily is the current maintainer of the Ruby driver
* Embedded documents great for immutable data.  A book's ISBN is a good example
* Emily's presentation style was great, presenting a suboptimal approach to querying data then presenting the optimal or 'MongoDB' way
* A MongoDB document can be no greater than 16MB


h3. Indexing and Query Optimization with Stephen Steneker


h3. Operating MongoDB in the Cloud with Adam Comerford


h3. "Shell Games":https://github.com/stennie/presentations/blob/master/MongoDB/Lightning/Shell%20Games.pdf?raw=true with Stephen Steneker
