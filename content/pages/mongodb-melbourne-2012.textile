Recently, I attended "MongoDB Melbourne 2012":http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-melbourne at The Marriott in the CBD.  The day featured "10gen":http://10gen.com talking about MongoDB plus a few interesting lightning talks.

I really enjoyed the day and took a few notes that I found interesting:

h3. "Schema Design":https://github.com/estolfo/presentations/blob/master/Schema-design/Schema%20Design%20By%20Example.pdf?raw=true with Emily Stolfo

* Emily is the current maintainer of the Ruby driver
* Embedded documents great for immutable data.  A book's ISBN is a good example
* Emily's presentation style was great, presenting a suboptimal approach to querying data then presenting the optimal or 'MongoDB' way
* A MongoDB document can be no greater than 16MB

h3. Indexing and Query Optimization with Stephen Steneker

I really enjoyed this presentation as there was so many juicy tips and tricks!

* EXPLAIN support for querying via @.explain()@
* When creating indices, 1 = ascending, -1 = descending
* Use @ensureIndex({ background: true })@ to index without blocking (there are some "caveats":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexes#Indexes-background%3Atrue however)
* Use @ensureIndex({ expireAfterSeconds: <int>})@ to remove documents after a certain number of seconds with a cleanup precision of 60 seconds ("TTL":http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/expire-data/)
* There is support for "Capped collections":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Capped+Collections which allows one to define a collection of a particular size and once full, oldest documents are removed
* Supports 2D "Geospatial indexing":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing (@$near@, @$within@, @$polygon@)
* @db.setProfilingLevel(n, slowms=100ms)@ n = 0, 1, 2 - default, all queries > 100ms logged
* When you see BasicCursor in the EXPLAIN query plan, that's a full table scan
* Calling @explain(true)@ gives more detail
* Query optimiser samples 1000 queries and decides best approach
* When using @^@ with Regex searching, this will take advantage of any indices
* "ElasticSearch River plugin":https://github.com/richardwilly98/elasticsearch-river-mongodb

h3. Operating MongoDB in the Cloud with Adam Comerford

* MongoDB server takes up 5% of available disk space when running in production mode
* Assumption made that any MongoDB servers running on Mac OS X are running in development mode
* Recommendation for production setup is to use RAID 10 to ensure a bad disk won't slow you down
* Running MongoDB in production - "http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Notes":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Notes
* Running MondoDB on EC2 - "http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Amazon+EC2":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Amazon+EC2

h3. "Shell Games":https://github.com/stennie/presentations/blob/master/MongoDB/Lightning/Shell%20Games.pdf?raw=true with Stephen Steneker

* Custom prompt
* .mongorc.js
* Prettier JSON output, colorised output "https://github.com/TylerBrock/mongo-hacker":https://github.com/TylerBrock/mongo-hacker
