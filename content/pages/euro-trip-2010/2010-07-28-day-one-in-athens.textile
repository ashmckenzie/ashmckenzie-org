h1. Day one in Athens

With a new day came renewed energy and focus.  We got up and headed to our new hotel which was roughly in the center of Athens, a place called Syntagma Square.  We checked in and dumped our luggage, next stop to purchase a new suitcase and some breakfast.  We found a nice little place with lots of Athenians inside which was a sure bet.  Even better was the luggage store in the adjoining arcade about 20 meters away that had 25% off suitcases!  With a shiny new suitcase similar to Alison's purchased, we jetted back to the hotel once more to do a drop off and then finally onto some sightseeing.  Our hotel was located right near Parliament, the sight of recent riots relating to the financial problems the country is facing.  There's red paint all over the place and an increased police and army presence in the area which initially made for some concern, but everything seemed under control.

We hailed a cab from the hotel, destined for "The Acropolis":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens.  The hotel porter assisted Alison and I getting into the cab and whispered in my ear 'No more than six euros' - meaning the journey to our destination should be no more than six euros.  I was quite impressed with this gesture and he was correct, it only cost around five euros.  Taxi's in Athens were cheap, really cheap... but in the case of The Acropolis, it's actually very close also.

After a bit of a struggle (it was very hot again today, high 30's and dry), we hit the top of The Acropolis and were greeted with an astonishing sight.  It was awe inspiring... being atop one of the highest points in Athens with not only relics and ruins in front of us but also a magnificent panoramic view of Athens as well.

We didn't spend too long at The Acropolis due to the heat, but it was amazing being up so high looking down on Athens, it was a very powerful moment.  We descended the ancient hill and opted for more modern (and lazy?) transportation back to our hotel.  Some days eating is a chore, a necessary event but today we'd worked up quite an appetite and were ready for some authentic Greek cuisine and craziness.  We stomped around the city for a bit, being cautious due to our experience the night before but soon found a restaurant serving traditional Greek cuisine.  Within minutes we were greeted, seated and part of the owner's (extended) family!  The owner took a real shining to us, because of our age and our ability to take a joke (at our expense) I guess.  Australians are generally well liked so far from our experience, some other countries like the US don't seem to find jokes at their expense amusing so are not so well received.  Most of the tourists we've come across are either Americans or Australians, both being extremely easy to differentiate :)  Back to the restaurant - we started to look at the menus before the owner came over and basically decided our meals for us based on whether we liked fish or beef!  We went along with it as it seemed like a good idea.  We had managed to order saganaki before the menus were whisked away, so out that came and it was delicious followed by some healthy swigs of Alfa, a tasty Greek beer.  And then came the main...  a HUGE plate of prawns, sardines, calamari, mussels and all sorts of other edible aquatic creatures.  Once the shock of the sheer size wore off we set about getting through the food, so we remained part of the family ;)  Towards the end of the meal Alison yelped and jolted the table, scaring everyone including myself.  She let out another yelp and said "there's something crawling up my pants!!!".  Alison managed to shake out the critter but not before it made it's way up to her knee through her jeans!  The critter turned out to be quite a large cockroach that had decided it was his dinner time and promptly moved onto the girl beside Alison who also yelped and scared more people!!  The owner came out and tried to assure us it was a flying bug of some description before slyly squishing it under his foot and hiding the evidence.  I'm not sure why he made up the story about the cockroach being something else because we were dining outside and near an old church being restored so it was bound to happen.  Alison did very well to not flip the table I thought!  Not long after that we rolled ourselves back to the hotel as we'd eaten way too much but were both satisfied :)

Tomorrow we're setting sail on a three island cruise where we'll visit Hyrda, Pyros and Aegina.  The cruise is an all day event with lots of lazing around on the boat... should be relaxing and fun!
