h1. Day two in Athens

We got up quite early, 5:45 AM in fact to make the 7:15 AM bus pickup for the all day cruise we had booked the day before.  We were scheduled to visit "Hydra":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_island, "Poros":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poros and "Aegina":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegina, a handful of the many Greek Islands.  The cruise was run by a group of mad Greeks who were constantly yelling at each other and carrying on, it was pretty funny :)  The cruise was complete with a band who organised traditional Greek dancing which everyone could participate in, but Alison and I moved from where it was taking place (bottom level) to the top level for some sun and quiet ;) (aren't we party poopers?!)  After some serious sun and lazing about we approached our first stop - Hydra.

Hydra was apparently the better of the three islands for swimming, but we had less than an hour on the island and we were a bit hungry by this stage (it was around 11 AM), so we grabbed something to eat and took in the view.  The place where we ate ("Sunset Hydra":http://www.sunsethydra.com/) boasts coming second for the "World's top restaurants with a view" :)  We munched down our food and headed back to the ship with just minutes to spare..  we were not far from being left behind!

Our next stop was Poros, another small but very beautiful island.  We must have departed late or lost time as we only had 45 minutes on Poros which was a shame.  We really only had time to tour up and down the main shops, buy a gelato and get back on the boat :(  We were a little bit peeved actually because we had thought we would have a lot of time on each island, but it ended up being more time on the boat where the emphasis seemed to be on reducing the weight of our wallets.  Nonetheless we had already managed to experience two amazing islands with one more to come.

By the time we approached the next island - Aegina, we were quite bored and wanted off the boat as it was crowded, stinking hot and we'd had enough of sitting around waiting.  We had paid for a bus tour on the island to see some ruins, and also learn some history from a guide (in a strange quasi Greek / English combination including humour!).  So off we went on the bus tour, spotting various ruins and famous houses, but we weren't allowed off the bus, which kind of sucked!  We took some photos, but because it was so sunny a lot of them didn't turn out due to the reflection on the glass which was a bit disappointing :(  We were educated on all sorts of things but I was most interested in the stories about pistachios!  They're everywhere on the island and are considered to be some of the finest quality in the world.  At the conclusion of the bus tour we were given a surprise... a small seafood snack and some traditional Greek spirit - Ouzo!  Alison and I shared a table with two other people (Alison wasn't too keen about this at all) who were very nice (but didn't speak a word of English, so there was a lot of nodding and smiling) and tucked into some prawns and calamari as well as Ouzo with water on ice.  The Ouzo was actually quite delicious and really cured our thirsts, even Alison's who doesn't like Ouzo at all!  After our food we made our way back to the boat, but not before we were coerced into buying some local pistachios from a local.  They were only six euro's for a very large bag and they are absolutely delicious!  They have an almost sweet apricot taste to them which sounds odd but tastes amazing.

About 30 minutes from Athens two large sea gulls (they looked like Pacific Gulls) starting flying very close to the right hand side of the boat, matching it's speed.  We thought that was amazing enough but what happened next was even better!  One of the cruise crew appeared with a small bread stick and held it out and whistled a few times.  The sea gull spotted the tasty snack and swooped in and plucked it straight from his hand!  Quite a few other passengers got in on the act and ensured everyone witnessed the event.  It was amazing to watch the birds gauge the wind and pick different lines to smoothly approach and stretch out and grab the snack at the last minute.  I'm sure it happens every day the cruise operates.

We finally reached Athens around 8 PM, exhausted and sun burnt but full of very fond memories.  On the bus ride back to our hotel Alison and I commented on how run down and derelict Athens is as the districts near the dock are quite different to the heart of Athens.  It's quite bad in some parts with the graffiti, destruction and almost brand new buildings completely gutted and overrun with weeds.  After seeing the beauty and peacefulness of the three islands we visited we both agreed if we were to ever return we would head straight out to sea!

8:45 PM ticked over and we were dropped off near our hotel.  We were just in time for the changing of the guard at Parliament.  We weren't sure if it was a regular event, but the two guards who were being relieved were also being scrutinised quite aggressively from a man in fatigues.  He was speaking to them in quite short and sharp sentences which were met with minor stance or posture adjustments before he moved onto the other guard to perform the same process.  The man in fatigues was a very imposing figure who looked at each and every one of us who were watching the ritual with contempt and disdain.  I was happy to get a shot and still have my camera to be honest!

After a massive day Alison and I pondered what we had seen and observed and to be honest, it was a real mixed set of thoughts and emotions.  On one hand you have the city of Athens which appears to be in a serious state of disarray with crime and public disorder evident in the graffiti and destruction of buildings but on the other you have the beauty and wonder of the ruins and islands.  Our time in Athens didn't start well at all, but ended on a much more positive note having witnessed some of the pure beauty that places not too far from the city have to offer.

Tomorrow we head off to Rome - another day, another new country!
