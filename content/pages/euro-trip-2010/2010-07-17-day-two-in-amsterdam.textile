h1. Day two in Amsterdam

Day two didn't get off to a great start as the weather was quite bad with heavy rain.  The temperature was still okay, around 20 &deg; Celsius however.  We had a bit of a sleep in and got up a bit later than normal.  As the weather was a bit average, we opted out of the canal tour which was a bit disappointing :(

We decided to do a spot of shopping, mainly to get Alison a new handbag and suitcase.  Alison's handbag was damaged in the torrential rain we had in Paris and was beginning to look like a mangy mutt with all it's bits hanging off (it wasn't that bad I thought but hey!)  Also, Alison's suitcase started to bottom out and was making a horrific scraping sound - think finger nails on a blackboard on a much larger scale.  We managed to score quite a deal on Alison's handbag, 35 &euro; instead of 70 &euro;.  The deal was brokered through some under-the-counter trickery involving switching receipts around, meaning we didn't get a receipt for the goods.  Nice!  On to find a new suitcase...  We used the Googler (anything that has Google maps is a Googler) to locate a large department store called de Bijenkorf which was sort of like Myer and David Jones combined, but a bit fancier.  Alison gravitated towards the Samsonite cases (yeah, tell me about it) which were very flash but reasonably priced, so we grabbed one.  It's a black hard shell case, quite large with four swiveling wheels on the bottom, it's a well engineered piece of kit.  It's bigger than the previous case which frightens me as it's already very heavy.

de Bijenkorf had the most amazing food court with all sorts of offerings - sushi, salad rolls, pastries, juices, beer, etc.  We grabbed a few things and munched down with enjoyment.  I'm kicking myself for not taking any photos as it was really cool with all the stainless steel benches, it was almost like you were in the kitchen of a large restaurant with all the stainless steel.

After a few moans and groans from eating too much food we headed back to our hotel to drop off the suitcase.  On the way back we spotted some trams which are almost identical to the trams back home.  No surprise really as I believe we get most of our transport vehicles (both trams and trains) from the Netherlands.  It was a little spooky seeing the familiar trams in unfamiliar territory.

We were kicking around a little bit in our hotel room when Alison decided we should check our tickets for the following days travel.  Our tickets from Amsterdam to Berlin stopped one top too early which meant we would have no easy way of making the next leg of the trip.  Alison asked twice back home to have the tickets verified and both times we were told it was okay.  It was not okay.  We waited in line at the train station for an hour and a half to have the tickets fixed and then we were on our way.  This was an incredibly frustrating experience to say the least.  It was 7 PM by this stage, so we decided it was high time for a beer and some food.  We'd spotted a really nice Tibetan place on the way back from Barney's the night before and decided to head there.  We wandered in and found only one table left, a table for two - just for us!  The service and food were fantastic, a common theme throughout our stay in Amsterdam.

Not feeling quite finished, we headed back to a pub / cafe we visited the day before - Cafe van Zuylen.  We had a Witbier and rubbed our full bellies for a little bit while admiring the decor.  I spotted another mouse run across the floor, guess it's due to the canals being so close.

We wandered back to our hotel, taking in all the Saturday night action.  We could have purchased any hard drug you could possibly imagine through any of the seedy looking characters who passed us by muttering their offerings.  One particular seedster had himself a perfect perch to peddle his wares - directly opposite a house in the red light district full of women flaunting themselves.  Seedy!

At night, the snack vendors move their goods closer out into the street and crank the lights so you can easily see what's on offer.  It's pretty amusing as there's more snack type foods (donuts, pastries, chocolates, cake, etc) than any of the restaurant food combined.  I wonder what market they're aiming for ? ;)

Tomorrow we head to Berlin on the train.  The total trip is around six hours which should see us arriving around 5 PM or there abouts.  So far the train rides have been without hiccup which has been a relief as I expected some grief along the way, maybe it's because my idea of train travel is VLine ?  Zing!
