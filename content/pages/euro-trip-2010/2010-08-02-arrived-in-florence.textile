h1. Arrived in Florence

Florence (or Firenze more correctly) was only a few hours train ride from Rome which was great as we only had two nights, so we needed to make the most of our time.  Our hotel was located directly beside the "Piazza del Duomo":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_del_Duomo,_Florence and aptly named, Hotel Duomo :)  Check out the view from our window!

We checked in around 1 PM or so and we were both really feeling the heat from the day before, we definitely had a touch of sun/heat stroke as we crashed for a few hours snooze.  Sightseeing is very tiring work!!  After a few hours snoozing and catching up on emails and news (thanks to an insecure wifi access point, thanks!) we set out to perform our nightly ritual of hunting down a place to eat.

On the dinner hunt we walked around The Duomo, taking a few photos.  It's so massive there's no way you can easily take a single frame of the entire building.  Being a fan of the video game Assassin's Creed, I was really looking forward to seeing the inspiration for the game and how it looked in the flesh.  With all the amazing sights we've seen so far, some things don't seem all that exciting once you finally see them, but not in this case!  The Duomo made you feel dizzy looking up at it, exploring each angle...  One of the highlights for me, no doubt about that.  Making comparisons is difficult (and not a good idea) but this was definitely one of the most amazing buildings I've ever witnessed.  Hunger called, so we moved on..

We had another cliche Italian dinner - tomato and mozzarella salad followed by pizza :)  The food, location (right beside The Duomo) and service were all fantastic which was exactly what we were craving after some average meals.  We haven't had any difficulties conversing / ordering our meals as English is well understood in all the places we've been so far which has been great.

Tomorrow we're going to wander around by foot because our hotel is so well situated.  We're going to see Michelangelo's David and a few other things which should be fun!
