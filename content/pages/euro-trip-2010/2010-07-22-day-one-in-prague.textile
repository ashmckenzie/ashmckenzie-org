h1. Day one in Prague

What a day!  The temperature reached 38 &deg; Celsius and the humidity was also very high, but despite all of that we pretty much covered the main tourist attractions in one day!  We started in the Old Town where we were staying and headed roughly towards Prague Castle.

Prague is definitely the highlight for me so far.  It's just so beautiful with all the amazing buildings that are so old but so alive.  All the streets are cobbled stones with not a hint of bitumen or concrete anywhere in the Old Town.  I'd definitely love to return one day to see more as one day was nowhere near enough to soak up what Prague has to offer.

Words really cannot express how wonderful Prague really was so I'll let the photos try telling the story :)
