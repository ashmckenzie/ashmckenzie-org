h1. Logrotate frequency and size

I wanted to rotate a log file daily OR if the size was greater than 2MB:

@/etc/logrotate.d/massive@

<pre data-language="shell">
/var/log/massive.log {
    daily
    size 2M
    rotate 7
}
</pre>

It turns out this is *not* possible as the @size@ options overrides the @daily,weekly,etc@ option (and vice-versa, whichever options appears last):

<pre data-language="shell">
$ sudo /usr/sbin/logrotate -dv /etc/logrotate.conf
</pre>

<pre data-language="shell">
rotating pattern: /var/log/massive.log  2097152 bytes (7 rotations)
..
</pre>

After changing @/etc/logrotate.d/massive@

<pre data-language="shell">
/var/log/massive.log {
    size 2M
    daily
    rotate 7
}
</pre>

<pre data-language="shell">
$ sudo /usr/sbin/logrotate -dv /etc/logrotate.conf
</pre>

<pre data-language="shell">
rotating pattern: /var/log/massive.log  after 1 days (7 rotations)
..
</pre>

Running @/usr/sbin/logrotate@ with @-dv@ was very helpful in diagnosing what was going on without making any changes.
