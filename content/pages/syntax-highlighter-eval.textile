h1. Syntax highlighter evaluation

Choosing a syntax highlighter turned out to be quite a task.  I tried the following: 

* "Coderay":http://coderay.rubychan.de
* "SHJS":http://shjs.sourceforge.net
* "SyntaxHighlighter":http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter
* and finally "Rainbows":http://craig.is/making/rainbows

I chose Rainbows in the end because of it's easy installation and the list of really great "themes":https://github.com/ccampbell/rainbow/tree/master/themes.  Here's how each syntax highlighter stacked up:
